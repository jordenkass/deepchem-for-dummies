# deepchem-for-dummies
My experiences as a chemist for installing and using deepchem


As a medicinal chemist interested in deep learning and trying to understand new tools to increase productivity I was very interested when I saw the blogpost by Derik Lowe on his in the pipeline blog (https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2019/05/14/an-intro-to-deep-learning) about Deepchem (https://deepchem.io/). Since I am not a programmer I was a bit overwhelmed when I tried to use the tool and was originally unable to get any of the tutorials to work. After a little bit of experience I have been at least able to get the tutorials to work. 

Here I plan on documenting first the installation of Deepchem and the required dependencies then as I get more familiar with the software I plan on documenting a how to use deepchem for dummies.
